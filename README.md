# Chem_GA_Project
This repository contains the code for a genetic algorithm (GA) program designed for chemical applications.  This GA is set up to optimize oligomers (short chain polymers) for a given molecular propert(ies).  The GA constructs oligomers from monomer fragments represented by SMILES strings.  It is currently set up to optimize them for both polarizability and dipole moment simultaneously, using GFN2-xTB for property calcuations.

This GA implementation was used for this project: https://github.com/danielle-elsey/oligomer-ga/

This code was the basis for an updated, more generalized polymer GA: https://github.com/hutchisonlab/hutchison-polymer-GA
